- This is the first step in Exploratory data analysis
1. Univariate data –
This type of data consists of only one variable. The analysis of univariate data is thus the simplest form of analysis since the information deals with only one quantity that changes. It does not deal with causes or relationships and the main purpose of the analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it 
2. Bivariate data –
This type of data involves two different variables. The analysis of this type of data deals with causes and relationships and the analysis is done to find out the relationship among the two variables.
3. Multivariate data –
When the data involves three or more variables, it is categorized under multivariate. Example of this type of data is suppose an advertiser wants to compare the popularity of four advertisements on a website, then their click rates could be measured for both men and women and relationships between variables can then be examined.

It is similar to bivariate but contains more than one dependent variable.
